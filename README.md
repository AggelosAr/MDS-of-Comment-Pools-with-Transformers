DistillBART, DistillPEGASUS and the T5Base Transformers models are fine-tuned on the ConvoSumm dataset. The best model (DistillBART) is tested on real world twitter comments and show nice results, managing to summarize large comment pools. The dataset can be found here https://github.com/Yale-LILY/ConvoSumm.
